# Google Safe Browsing API V2#

A ColdFusion conversion of the Google Safe Browsing Pythong reference code. 

# Getting Started #

This is NOT finished.  The only fully implemented file is the hashprefix_trie.py.  There is an mxunit test for this file.  Some work has been done on the server.cfc

# Help Needed! #
Please help me finish this library.  Get the [original reference Python code](http://code.google.com/p/google-safe-browsing/downloads/list).  I'm using v0.3.
